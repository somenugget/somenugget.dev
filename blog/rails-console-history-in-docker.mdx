When you use dockerized Rails app you might guess why you can’t see you rails console commands history or `debug` commands history.

The thing is that `irb` or  `debug` or `pry` by default save their histories in user’s home directory (unlike `byebug` which saves history in project’s root).

Docker will purge those history files between runs so to solve this issue you can explicitly tell the gem to keep file in project’s root.

For `irb` it can be set via `.irbrc` file

```ruby
IRB.conf[:HISTORY_FILE] = '.irb_history'
```

For `pry`  via `.pryrc`

```ruby
Pry.config.history_file = '.pry_history'
```

For `debug` via `.rdbgrc`

```ruby
config set history_file '.rdbg_history'
```

And don’t forget to add these history files to `.gitignore` since they are in your project root now.
